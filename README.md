# Homework 3: JS Password Generator

## Objective 

Create a interactive password generator using primarily Javascript code to select characteristics of the password.

## Changes

I implemented this algorithm when the button is pressed (algorithm code is commented similarly highlighting main parts of the algorithm):

1. Use a data structure (object) to determine attributes of password to be generated (which characters to include or exclude).

2. Run a command to modify the global object using prompt, confirm, and alert.

3. Using the updated global object, create a string including all values that are marked to be included in the password.

4. Randomly index characters out of that 'values' string to generate a password of the given length (using for loop).

5. Return password to parent function.
